# Mixed_Messages

## General info
Mixed Messages is my first Codecademy Portfolio Project.

It consists of a message generator. Every time a user runs this program, they will get a new randomized message about the topic Coding.

## Built with
It was built with [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) on [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using my knowledge learnt so far in the [Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer career path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path).

## Setup
Download the files above and run `$ node script.js` on your terminal :)
