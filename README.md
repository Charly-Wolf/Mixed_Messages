# Mixed_Messages

## General info
Mixed Messages is my first Codecademy Portfolio Project.

It consists of a message generator. Every time a user runs this program, they will get a new randomized message about the topic Coding.

## Built with
It was built with [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) using my knowledge learnt so far in the [Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer carrer path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path).
